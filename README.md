# MKB-Syntax-Highlighting

**Macro/Keybind Mod Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text 3**

**Custom syntax highlighting for Macro/Keybind Mod + Modules**

*You could modify it to work on your own text editor, probably by using the regular expression matches and captures. You could also reference the minecraft hex color codes, which are pretty nice.*

## Set Up:

There are 2 files: __MKB.yaml__ which is a YAML file, with the regexes and assigning scopes to them. __MKB.json__ is for the custom colors and rules. 

## Useful links:

https://packagecontrol.io/installation

https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev/blob/master/README.md

*Note that the menus might be different depending on your os, so you can always use the text editor's help*

You need to get PackageDev for this, by doing `Preferences > Package Control` and then type `Package Control: Install Package`, afterwards find `PackageDev` in the menu and install it. 

To install __MKB.yaml__, you need to go to `Tools > Developer > New Syntax...` and paste everything into the page, save it as MKB.sublime-syntax.

Next you need to add the custom colors in __MKB.json__, and to do that you go to. `Tools > Packages > Package Development > Edit Current Color Scheme...` Paste the entire json contents into the **Right Side** of the color scheme, for the user. 

## Usage:

When opening a txt or rtf file (can be configured), if the first line is `$${` it will automatically change to `MKB` syntax. But if it doesnt work, then you can go to the bottom left corner, and click `User`, and change `Plain Text` to `MKB`. 

## How does it work?

The new sublime syntax will recognize the actions, variables, parameters, iterators... of macro mod and common modules, using regex it assigns a scope to it. The scope is then assigned a color in the color scheme file, and then you get custom syntax highlighting!
